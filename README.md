# PokemonQuestCooking

tl;dr click ingredients, fill pot, hit start, hope it works

WIP. First part will be a cooking screen similar to what is found in Pokemon Quest. The user should be able to select ingredients, hit start cooking, and the output should appear on the side. The GUI is also a WIP. Currently, for recipes that are shared between dishes, the app is only able to show the dish lower in the list. I'm working on getting it to show all dishes that the recipe satisfies, but ofc, only one will actually be made in game. This also doesn't show mulligan. I'll add later.

Second part will be selecting a dish and getting recipes for different qualities. I'll flesh this out some more later.

Third part will be selecting a pokemon and seeing which dishes they will likely come from.

Hopefully, I actually stay motivated to finish this.
