# PokemonQuestCooking

tl;dr click ingredients, fill pot, hit start, hope it works

Still a huge WIP. GUI needs reworking, but that will wait until after I've finished adding most of the features that I would like. Currently, the app can accept inputs from the ingredient selection panel and cook up a dish from a full pot. It'll display the dish's icon, the quality of the dish, and the type of the dish. 

As of June 8th, rainbow matter and rainbow shell aren't supported (only because I'm lacking a good icon for the rainbow shell), and thus, the ambrosia of legends isn't supported either. Type logos for mulligan, red stew, blue soda, yellow curry, and gray porridge are non-existant (currently, in the works).

Currently planned:
Selecting a dish and getting recipes for different qualities. I'll flesh this out some more later.
Selecting a pokemon and seeing which dishes they will likely come from.

Hopefully, I actually stay motivated to finish this.
